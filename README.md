# ðŸ”¥ Firecrawl

Crawl and convert any website into LLM-ready markdown. Build by [Mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai?ref=gfirecrawl)

_This repository is currently in its early stages of development. We are in the process of merging custom modules into this mono repository. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by utilizing clean data. It is not ready for full self-host yet - we're working on it_

## What is Firecrawl?

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown for each. No sitemap required.

_Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers :)_

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

crawl_result = app.crawl_url('mendable.ai', {'crawlerOptions': {'excludes': ['blog/*']}})

# Get the markdown
for result in crawl_result:
    print(result['markdown'])
```

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape_url` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

```python
url = 'https://example.com'
scraped_data = app.scrape_url(url)
```

### Search for a query

Performs a web search, retrieve the top results, extract data from each page, and returns their markdown.

```python
query = 'What is Mendable?'
search_result = app.search(query)
```
